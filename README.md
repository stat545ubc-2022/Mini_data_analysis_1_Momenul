# Mini Data Analysis 
This project is a part of the [STAT 545A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/) course.

## Project introduction/objective
This project is to analyse a data in R. It contains two milestones. The first milestone starts the analysis from data extraction and ends with finalizing two research questions. The second one makes an in-dept exploration of those research questions through modeling and finalizes with answers.

### Topics covered in Milestone 1
 
 * Data extraction for R packages
 * Exploring the data sets in R package
 * Selecting the best appropriate data 
 * Exploring variables in the selected data set through tables and graphs 
 * Generating research questions from exploration
 * Exploring more and finalizing the research questions


### Topics covered in Milestone 2

  * Continuing with the finalized research questions to answer
  * Exploring through data reshaping 
  * In-dept looking through modeling 
  * Concluding with answer from model fit
